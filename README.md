# BettingBot

• Used Selenium to web scrap from multiple sportsbooks for latest odds on NBA events and compared to that of a betting exchange (which offer the true odds) to see if odds on sportsbooks
are greater than that of the true odds on the betting exchange, giving opportunities for positive expected value.
• Designed a bot using Python to compare odds offered by various sportsbooks to find arbitrage opportunities for a given NBA
game. Alerts via email when such opportunity exists.
